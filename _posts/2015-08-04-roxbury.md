title: Create a basic histogram
---

This data is from Universal Hub. It shows the crimes in a certain area, and the times they occur. I am particularly concerned with the area I am currently staying in Boston: Roxbury. The data was recorded from Jan 2014 - August 2015.

	> df<-read.csv("roxbury.csv",header=FALSE,row.names=NULL)
	> head(df)
	    V1
	1   55
	2   45
	3   43
	4   35
	5 2355
	6 2330
	> hist(df$V1,
	+ main="Roxbury Crime",
	+ xlab="Time",
	+ xlim=c(0,2500),
	+ breaks=24)

Each bar represents 1 hour.

The 3 groups I want to analyze are from 1:00 AM - 10:00 AM (A), 12:00 PM - 4:00 PM (B), and 6:00 PM - 11:00 PM (C).

Lets make the assumption that most people are out during B, at least 3x the number of people out during A or C alone.

The crime rates are highest in B and C, but lowest in A.

Since more than 3x the number of people are out during B than A or C, and the crime rate in B is around 3x the rate in A, it is just as safe or safer to be out in B than in A or C.

The safest time appears to be from 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM, and from 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM, when I assume there is high traffic from people going to and from work and crime rates are relatively low.

Potential further analyses would include weekends vs weekdays, and parsing the data by season.
