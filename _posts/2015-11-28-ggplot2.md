title: How to use ggplot2
---

ggplot2 offers a scalable way to build customized plots in R. If you can understand the basic structure of ggplot2, it's easy to add on to create beautiful visuals. So let's get started with looking at the basic structure of using ggplot, the terms involved, some plot types, and additional add-ons. A fantastic cheatsheet for ggplot2 can be found [here.](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)


**libraries needed**

	library(ggplot2)
	library(ggthemes)


**structure**

	a<-ggplot(data,aes(x="",y="",group="",fill="",color="",shape=""))
		+geom_PlotType()


**ggplot basic terms**

data - which data frame to pull in

x - specify x value

y - specify y value

group=x - break out plot routed to x

fill=x - fill color routed to x

color=x - outline color routed to x

shape=x - for geoms that draw points, with points routed to x


**some plot types**

geom_bar()  
geom_line()  
geom_boxplot()  
geom_jitter()  


**additional stuff**

ggtitle() - adds title

theme_bw() - remove grey background

theme_minimal() - my go-to theme with minimal design

facet_grid(x~.,scales="fixed") - facet plot based on x. Scales can be fixed, also commonly "free_y" or "free", which includes both x and y scales

eom_vline(xintercept=c(x1, x2), colour="black", linetype = "longdash") - add vertical lines
