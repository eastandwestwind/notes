title: How to merge and sum common columns
---

Two data frames, year1 and year2, each with columns "team" "goals" "wins".

I want to create a df that combines the 2 years by team, summing the goals and wins by team.

	df<-ddply(rbind(year1, year2), .(team), summarize, goals = sum(goals), wins = sum(wins))
