title: How to create a topic model
---

Takes vector and groups words into topics based on frequency of use with other words. Using CTM, VEM, VEM_Fixed, and Gibbs models.

	library(NLP)
	library(topicmodels)
	library(SnowballC)

	mach_text <- iconv(vector,to="utf-8-mac")
	mach_corpus = Corpus(VectorSource(mach_text))
	doc.lengths <- rowSums(as.matrix(DocumentTermMatrix(mach_corpus)))
	dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(mach_corpus[doc.lengths > 0])

	# set seed for replication
	SEED = 20  
	k = 5
	models <- list(
	    CTM       = CTM(dtm, k = k, control = list(seed = SEED, var = list(tol = 10^-4), em = list(tol = 10^-3))),
 	   VEM       = LDA(dtm, k = k, control = list(seed = SEED)),
 	   VEM_Fixed = LDA(dtm, k = k, control = list(estimate.alpha = FALSE, seed = SEED)),
 	   Gibbs     = LDA(dtm, k = k, method = "Gibbs", control = list(seed = SEED, burnin = 1000,
     	                                                            thin = 100,    iter = 1000))
    	)
	
List of topics:

	l<-lapply(models, terms, 5) 

Analysis:

	assignments <- sapply(models, topics) 

Graph:

	library(lasso2)
	b<-build_graph(CTM, .5, and = TRUE)
