title: How to compose music in R
---

I wanted to have some fun with playing music using R. Turns out there's a nice little library called tuneR. I've assigned notes to sine waves of various frequencies and durations, then lapply'd over a vector containing the notes to play twinkle twinkle little star. Had to find a minor workaround for playing the sounds through a mac, the url of which I have included [here](http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/donbyrd/RTools+Docs/tuneRPlaybackOnMacs.html) for reference.

	library(tuneR)
	setwd("/Dropbox/Rfiles")

	a<-sine(440,duration=5000)
	a2<-sine(440,duration=10000)
	e<-sine(659.26,duration=5000)
	e2<-sine(659.26,duration=10000)
	fs<-sine(739.99,duration=5000)
	d<-sine(587.33,duration=5000)
	cs<-sine(554.37,duration=5000)
	b<-sine(493.88,duration=5000)
	b2<-sine(493.88,duration=10000)

	twinkle<-c(a,a,e,e,fs,fs,e2,d,d,cs,cs,b,b,a2,e,e,d,d,cs,cs,b2,e,e,d,d,cs,cs,b2,a,a,e,e,fs,fs,e2,d,d,cs,cs,b,b,a2)

	play<-lapply(twinkle,function(i){
		play(i,"/Library/Audio/playRWave")
	})
