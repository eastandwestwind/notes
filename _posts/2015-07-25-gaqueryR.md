title: Pull data from Google Analytics using R
---

To use the GA Core Reporting API, install devtools and rga:

	install.packages("devtools")
	library(devtools)
	install_github("rga", "skardhamar")
	library(rga)

You can find more about the rga library on [GitHub](https://github.com/skardhamar/rga).

Check out the [Google Analytics Query Explorer](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/query-explorer/) to explore possible queries you can write.

Note that if you wanted to write multiple queries, you can also add on to this.

	> write.csv(sessions_city, file = "sessions_city.csv",row.names=FALSE)  

There, now you should be able to open the .csv in excel and do what you need. Be aware that in your queries with multiple entries per parameter, filters are separated by semicolons, while metrics and dimentions are separated by commas.


If, for some reason, the rga library isn't working, try the RGA library, with a bit of different syntax:

	library(RGA)

	authorize(client.id = "xxxxxx", client.secret = "xxxxxxx")

	startdate <- "2015-10-01"
	enddate <- "2015-11-27"
	id <- "ga:xxxxxxx"


	df <- get_ga(
		id,
		start.date = startdate,
		end.date = enddate,
		metrics="ga:sessions",
		dimensions="ga:medium,ga:year,ga:nthDay",
		segment= ,
		sort = "ga:nthDay",
		filter = ,
		start = 1,
		max = 10000,
	)
