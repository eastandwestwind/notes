title: How to unzip and read multiple files
---

I've got multiple zip files, each containing daily logs of traffic info to a website. Each line is one entry, containing ip address, date, and many other things about the visitor. What I need is an output of 1 csv file, with date and ip address as columns.

First I need to unzip the files, read the unzipped files into one giant data frame, so I can easily extract the info I need.

Here goes:

	#specify zip directory
	>fileList <- list.files(path="/Users/csmith/Dropbox/zip", pattern=".zip")
	#unzip and create new directory
	>sapply(fileList,function(i){
	+	unzip(i,exdir="/Users/csmith/Dropbox/unzip")
	+})

	#specify unzip directory
	>setwd("/Users/csmith/Dropbox/unzip")
	>fileList<- list.files(path="/Users/csmith/Dropbox/unzip")
	#read tables, create distinct rows
	>df<-lapply(fileList, function(i){
	+	read.table(i,header=FALSE,sep="\t")
	+})

	#bind tables
	>df<-do.call(rbind,df)

Now I have one giant data frame, with 1 column, V1. I'm going to use V1 as a general template to extract the data that I need.

	#create column for date, which is a duplicate of V1, except I remove everything after the colon.
	>df$date<-gsub( ":.*$", "", df$V1)

Here I get rid of extra stuff in the date column.

	#remove everything before space in column date
	>df$date<-gsub(".* ", "", df$date)
	#remove bracket in column date
	>df$date<-gsub("\\[|\\]","",df$date)

Now that I have the date column the way I want it, I need an ip address column.

	#create column for ip address, remove everything after space in column V1
	>df$ip<-gsub(" .*$", "", df$V1)
	#remove column V1 because I don't need it.
	>df$V1<-NULL

Some ip addresses show up twice because they take multiple actions on the site. I don't need duplicates.

	#only show unique ip/date combos
	>df<-unique(df)

I also only want IPv4 IP addresses.

	#remove IPv6 IP addresses
	>df <- df[-grep("\\:",df$ip),]
	# write to csv
	>write.csv(df,file="unzipmaster.csv",row.names=FALSE)

There you have it.
